**TavernRaid – Mobile App (HSUP Project)**

This repository contains the frontend prototype of TavernRaid, a mobile application developed as part of the Hungarian Startup University Program (HSUP). The app was built by our student team, and I was responsible for implementing the frontend using React Native.

⚠️ Note: This version is a standalone frontend mock. The fully integrated version connected to the backend was unfortunately lost. To simulate application behavior, this version uses mock objects to represent data and interactions.

📽️ Demo

✨ Features (Mocked Version)
- User Authentication – Simulated login and registration screens.
- Interactive Map – A map interface (mocked for this version).
- User Profile – Editable user profile page.
- Multiple Screens – Several views populated with mock data representing real app content.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- React Native – Cross-platform mobile development framework.
- JavaScript – Application logic and interface.
- Expo – Toolchain for building and testing React Native apps easily.
- Mock Data – Placeholder content and objects used to simulate backend interaction.
